Currently this is just a text file with step by step instructions to install Mainsail, Klipper and Moonraker on a AML-S905X-CC SOC (aka Le Potato). Soon there will be bash scripts and other automation to cover the installation with possible crossover to a Fluidd install if there is enough interest.
