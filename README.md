Currently this is just a text file with step by step instructions to install Mainsail, Klipper and Moonraker on a AML-S905X-CC SOC (aka Le Potato). This thing: https://libre.computer/products/aml-s905x-cc/ . These instructions are verified working at the moment. Please reach out to me or raise an issue if you find any discrepancies. 

Soon there will be bash scripts and other automation to cover the installation with possible crossover to a Fluidd install if there is enough interest.
