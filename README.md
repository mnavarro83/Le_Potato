# Introduction

  Currently this is just a couple of md files with step by step instructions to install Raspbian, Mainsail, Klipper and Moonraker on a AML-S905X-CC SOC (aka Le Potato). This thing: https://libre.computer/products/aml-s905x-cc/ . These instructions are verified working at the moment. Please reach out to me or raise an issue if you find any discrepancies. 

  Soon there will be automation to cover the installation with possible crossover to a Fluidd install if there is enough interest.
